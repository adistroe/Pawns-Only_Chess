### About
This is the ***Pawns-Only Chess*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>Chess is a very popular game, but over time even the classic chess rules may become tiresome. The good news is that there are hundreds of variants.</p>
<p>One of them is Pawns-only chess. Let's make a game where players should move their pawns to the opposite side of the board or capture all opposite pawns to win.</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/3">Kotlin Developer</a></li>
</ul>
